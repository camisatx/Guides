# Guides

This is a collection of technical guides that I have assembled from my notes. Some are little more than singular commands, where others include descriptions on what is occurring.

Contents:
- [DNSCrypt Random Server Setup](../master/DNSCrypt_Random_Server_Instructions.md)
- [Git Command Line Commands](../master/Git_CLI_Commands.md)
- [Python Command Line Commands](../master/Python_CLI_Commands.md)
- [PostgreSQL Backup Strategies](../master/PostgreSQL_Backup_Strategies.md)
- [Ubuntu Server Commands](../master/Ubuntu_Commands.md)
  - [Server Setup Script](../master/scripts/new_server_setup)


If you have any guides that you'd like to share, please raise an issue with the contents or submit a merge request with your guide.
